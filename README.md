# thompson

A JVM library for performing computational algebra experiments in [Thompson's group F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups).

The core algorithms are implemented in Java and therefore easily accessible from any JVM language.

This project also includes a web interface to these algorithms, implemented in [Clojure](http://clojure.org) on the [Ring](http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring) library.
