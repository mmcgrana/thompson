# thompson

A JVM library for performing computational algebra experiments in [Thompson's group F](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_groups).

The core algorithms are implemented in Java and therefore easily accessible from any JVM language.

This project also implements a web interface to these algorithms, available at [thompson-web.appspot.com](http://thompson-web.appspot.com).
